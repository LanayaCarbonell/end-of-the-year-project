# Benefits of having a Calorie-Tracker

Ever wonder how much daily intake of calories you eat? Or probably you want to keep track of the calories you eat because you want that "summer bod".
There is plenty of reasons why to have a Calorie-Tracker, that records what is you eat for a whole day! 

My **idea** is to create a Calorie-Tracker that can simply...

Track down a person's daily intake of food that will last for 24 hours! 

Add up the amount of calories they eat during the day.


## 1. **_DOWNLOADING FILES_**

Mr.Enrico said I need to download/import LOTS of files for the food data base (possibly 12)

I need to also import time and date(for the tracking of the day and meals), and math(for the addition of calorie intake)

## 2. **_WHAT WILL THE PROGRAM DO?_**

Ideally, I want my program to have someone sign in for the user, tell the date, and ask the question: 
*"Is this Breakfast, Lunch, Brunch, or Dinner?"*

The user will put in what they ate. For Ex: Taco Bell, Chalupa. 

The command prompt will then ask, *How many?* for for something that runs in OUNCES/GRAMS, it will ask *How _much_?* 
(dont know how I am going to work that out but nothing with python is impossible)

**POTENTIONALLY* I would like to have a command prompt that suggest the food, like a drop down bar, so the user does not need to be SO specific with what they write, or have less typos. 

For ex: A person might be writing  BELL, as they are writing TACO BE- the command prompt can simply have a drop down suggestion bar, and probably have a list of no more than 20 suggestions. I will ask Mr.Enrico if that is even possible


## A. **_What should I do to start?_**
